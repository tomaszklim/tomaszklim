### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome on my Github summary page! I work in IT for almost 25 years. Previously I worked for big global companies like Wikia or Allegro Group. Since 2013, I run my own company. Below you'll find some of my projects.

[Drive Badger](https://drivebadger.com/) in an open source platform for covert data exfiltration operations, ranging from small computers to big servers, supporting any version of Windows, Linux and Mac OS, also with Bitlocker, LUKS, VeraCrypt or Apple FileVault full disk encryption.

Written in 2020 strictly for law enforcement officers, private investigators, corporate Red Teams etc. (see [legal details](https://github.com/drivebadger/drivebadger/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-(legal))), as cold attack complement to my closed source [Sherlock](https://payload.pl/sherlock/) platform.

- [serverfarmer/heartbeat-linux](https://github.com/serverfarmer/heartbeat-linux) - Heartbeat monitoring subproject (can be used separately)
- [serverfarmer/heartbeat-server](https://github.com/serverfarmer/heartbeat-server) - Heartbeat server part
- [serverfarmer/sf-backup](https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-backup) - backup (client part)
- [serverfarmer/sm-backup-collector](https://github.com/serverfarmer/sm-backup-collector) - backup (server part)
